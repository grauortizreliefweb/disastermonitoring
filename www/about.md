ReliefWeb is a humanitarian information service provided by the [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)](https://www.unocha.org/). The editorial team monitors and collects information from more than 4,000 key sources, including humanitarian agencies at the international and local levels, governments, think-tanks and research institutions, and the media.

ReliefWeb is also a valuable resource for [job listings](https://reliefweb.int/jobs) and [training programs](https://reliefweb.int/training), helping humanitarians organizations to disseminate career and training opportunities to global audience.

Our team is committed to building new and better digital products and services. In [ReliefWeb Labs](https://labs.reliefweb.int/), we continue to experiment with better ways to share information for todayâ€™s humanitarians.
